# Minimal Blockchain in Rust

This project aims to build a minimal blockchain in Rust with the goal of creating a decentralized world computer. Please note that this project is a work in progress. This is meant for education purposes.

## Components

The blockchain system consists of the following components:

- Virtual Machine (VM):
  The VM is responsible for executing smart contracts and implementing a quasi Turing machine. It provides an environment where contract code can be executed, and it assigns gas to control the resource usage and prevent infinite loops.
